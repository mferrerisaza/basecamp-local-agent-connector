  # stale credentials file, and the command fails with auth_required or a
  # token-refresh api_error although nothing is wrong with the credentials
  # (19/20 parallel probes lost in a 20-way run; 20/20 serial ones passed).
  # The race clears as soon as the neighbours finish, so a failed invocation
  # is tried again after a short, growing pause: ~2s of waiting per command,
  # plus the calls themselves. A verification that runs two commands (a
  # comment on a subscribed recording: `show`, then `subscriptions show`)
  # can still overrun the 10s Basecamp allows a webhook delivery, which the
  # bridge tolerates (see Bridge#handler).

  # A CLI that classifies its own failures says so in its error envelope: a
  # top-level boolean `retryable`, the SDK's Retryable flag surfaced, on every
  # error envelope and never on a success. The field speaks in one direction
  # only. `true` is a positive signal — the CLI knows the failure was its own
  # plight, whatever the code or message — and is retried without consulting
  # the list below. `false` is not a verdict but the absence of that signal:
  # the CLI stamps it on Basecamp's refusals and on every failure nothing
  # classified, which includes the three CLI-local failures the retry loop
  # exists for (a lost keyring probe surfaces as auth_required; a token
  # refresh that lost the race as api_error; bc3's 500 is left unclassified
  # by the SDK). So `false` falls through to the list, which the field can
  # widen but never narrow. That reading also covers the CLI releases before
  # the field, whose envelopes carry only ok/error/code/hint/meta.
  #
  # The list names what the field does not: the code and, for `api_error`,
  # the message. `api_error` is ambiguous: Basecamp's own 4xx verdicts arrive
  # as one, but so do three failures to get an answer at all — a token
  # refresh that lost the keyring race ("token refresh failed: …"), bc3
  # answering 5xx ("Server error (500)" surfaces at once; "Gateway error
  # (502|503|504)" and the generic "API error: 5xx …" are retried inside the
  # SDK for ~3s first and then surface as "request failed after 3 attempts:
  # …", a prefix the SDK puts only on retryable failures), and the CLI's own
  # circuit breaker refusing to ask ("Service temporarily unavailable":
  # file-backed across processes, open for 30s after five consecutive
  # network/5xx failures). A rate limit is transient too, in either spelling
  # (the dedicated code above, or bc3's "rate limit exceeded" body relayed as
  # an api_error): "not now" is no verdict on the recording, and the
  # account-wide budget rolls over in seconds — so a webhook defers to
  # redelivery and a poller to its next (backed-off) tick, rather than
  # recording a drop. A spelling the CLI stamps `retryable: true` needs no
  # entry here; one it leaves at `false` does, until the CLI classifies it.
