# Basecamp Agent Connector (experimental)

> [!WARNING]
> <mark>**Experimental.**</mark> This drives agents from Basecamp using the pieces that
> already exist: webhooks, the [`basecamp` CLI](https://basecamp.com/cli), a
> funnel on your own machine. Proper first-class support is being built; expect
> this to be replaced by it, not to grow into it.

Drive local coding agents from Basecamp. **@mention an agent user** (e.g.
`@Clawdito fix the calendar bug`) in any Basecamp comment, message, or card — and
an agent on **your** machine picks it up, gathers the surrounding context
from Basecamp, does the work in the right repo, and **replies as that agent
user**, right where you asked.

Basecamp is already where the work and its context live — a comment sits inside a
card, inside a project, with a thread and a creator. Instead of copy-pasting all
that into a terminal, you write where the work is and let the agent pull the
context it needs.

---

## Usage

### What it feels like

1. In Basecamp, you comment on a card: **“@Clawdito the date picker is off by one — please fix.”**
2. On your laptop, the agent wakes up, reads the card and its thread, figures out
   which repo this is, and starts working.
3. A few minutes later, **Clawdito replies on the same card** with what it did
   (and, ideally, a PR link). If it hit a wall, it replies with the error and
   @mentions you.

You never leave Basecamp. The agent runs locally, as you, with your tools.

### The one-time setup

You need three things in place:

1. **The runtime** — clone the repo and install dependencies:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/basecamp/basecamp-local-agent-connector
   cd basecamp-local-agent-connector
   bin/setup        # bundle install + checks for the `basecamp` and `tailscale` CLIs
   ```

   You also need [Tailscale](https://tailscale.com) with **Funnel enabled** for
   your tailnet (Basecamp has to reach your machine over the public internet) and
   Ruby 3.4+.

2. **An agent user + its local profile.** The agent is a *real Basecamp user*
   (e.g. a bot account named “Clawdito”) that you can @mention. The connector
   talks to Basecamp through the [`basecamp` CLI](https://basecamp.com/cli),
   which supports named **profiles** — and the agent name you pass must match a
   local profile authenticated **as that agent user**:

   ```bash
   basecamp auth login --profile clawdito   # log in as the Clawdito account
   basecamp me --profile clawdito           # verify it's Clawdito, not you
   ```

   Your own login is the default profile (the **operator** — the only person
   allowed to trigger the agent). The agent and the operator **must be different
   Basecamp users**, otherwise the agent’s own replies would trigger it again.

3. **The skill** — install it into Claude Code:

   ```bash
   npx skills add basecamp/basecamp-local-agent-connector       # this project only
   npx skills add basecamp/basecamp-local-agent-connector -g    # user-level, all projects
   ```

   (Or just run Claude Code from a clone of this repo — the skill is
   auto-discovered via `.claude/skills`.)

   **Updating:** the install is a snapshot copy fetched from GitHub, so editing
   this repo does *not* change an installed skill. After changes land on `main`,
   refresh with:

   ```bash
   npx skills update -g    # or without -g for a project-level install
   ```

### Using it

In Claude Code, run `/basecamp-connect` and say who should watch what.
**There's no syntax to memorize** — the skill reads plain English. It needs an
**agent** (an `@profile`) and at least one **project** — or, for a GitHub-only
run, just a **repo**, with no agent and no project. Everything else has a sane
default and can be said in passing.

```
/basecamp-connect @Clawdito on BC5 Calendar
/basecamp-connect watch BC5.1 and On Call as @Clawdito
/basecamp-connect @Clawdito — projects BC5.1, On Call, and 20361308
/basecamp-connect use @Clawdito to watch https://3.basecamp.com/2914079/projects/41746046
/basecamp-connect @Clawdito on Queenbee, with jorge as the operator
/basecamp-connect @Clawdito on On Call, and let anyone on the project trigger it
/basecamp-connect @Clawdito on BC5.1, and let marie@37signals.com trigger it too  # admin operators only
/basecamp-connect @Clawdito on BC5.1 plus PR reviews on basecamp/bc3
/basecamp-connect @Clawdito on On Call, poll chat every 30s, skip boosts
/basecamp-connect watch PR reviews on basecamp/bc3
```

> [!TIP]
> **You only have to say it once.** Every successful connection is stored in
> `~/.config/basecamp-connect/last.json` — agent, projects, trust, and polling —
> so invoking `/basecamp-connect` with nothing after it picks those up. It shows
> you what it remembered and asks before reconnecting, so the usual second
> session is just `/basecamp-connect` and a yes.

The flag form still works too, if you prefer typing it that way —
`/basecamp-connect @Clawdito --project "BC5 Calendar" --project "On Call"` — and
it's what gets handed to `bin/connect` underneath either way. Skip it: say what
you want.

Then go to Basecamp and @mention `@Clawdito` in a comment, message, or card with
what you want done. Each time you do, the agent runs and replies.

A few things worth knowing about what you can ask for:

- **A project can be a name, a URL, or an ID.** Any of the three resolves; a
  partial name is fine if it's unambiguous.
- **Several projects, one connector.** One webhook per project, all multiplexed
  onto a single funnel path, so the same `@agent` watches every project you named
  at once. Add as many as you like.
- **You alone can trigger it, unless you say otherwise.** The agent acts with
  your full machine authority, so widening the trust set hands that authority to
  more people — deliberate, never incidental. Four modes exist; ask for one in
  the same sentence ("let anyone on the project trigger it", "let Marie trigger
  it too"). **One caveat that decides which to pick:** unless you're a Basecamp
  account admin, the API hands you colleagues' email addresses masked, so the
  two email-keyed modes add nobody. Read [Trust modes](#trust-modes) before
  relying on any of them.
- **GitHub PR reviews ride the same server.** Ask for a repo ("plus PR reviews on
  basecamp/bc3") and review events arrive on the same funnel. A webhook watches
  the whole repo, so **only reviews on pull requests you opened reach the
  agent** — a review on a colleague's PR is somebody else's work, with no branch
  of yours behind it, and is dropped. Of the reviews that are on your PRs, only
  **your** approvals (the login `gh` is signed in as) reach the agent as
  `approved`; someone else's approval is dropped, while their requested changes
  and comments still come through. The other thing filtered out is the agent
  talking to itself: it posts under **your** account, so a comment review from your login
  whose body and every inline comment start with the 🤖 prefix agents put on
  their PR comments is its own reply, and never reaches you. If the body or any
  one of those comments doesn't start with 🤖, the whole review comes through,
  agent parts and all.
- **Two shapes are valid, and that's the whole requirement.** An agent and at
  least one project, for watching Basecamp; or a repo on its own, for a
  GitHub-only run — no agent, no project. You can also have both at once.

### More than one connector

Two connectors on the same agent and project is always a mistake: Basecamp
delivers each event to both, so one mention dispatches two agents and gets two
replies. `bin/connect` now refuses to start beside a live run that overlaps,
names the other run's pid, and exits. `--allow-duplicate` overrides it if you
really mean to.

Each run records itself in `~/.config/basecamp-connect/runs/<pid>.json` — what it
watches, and the funnel paths it owns — and removes that file at teardown. So
you can always ask what's running:

```bash
bin/connect --status
```

That is also the answer to *"is this leftover webhook safe to delete?"* — a
question that used to be a guess, and once cost a running connector eleven of
its webhooks. If a registration's `payload_url` ends in a path `--status` names,
it belongs to a live run. **Don't delete a webhook you can't attribute:** it may
be another session's, another machine's, or an older build's (those register
under `/hook/<secret>` rather than `/bc5/<secret>`), and deleting one leaves that
connector silently deaf to Basecamp while it goes on polling chat.

`--status` also consults the process table, because the registry only knows runs
that started with it. A connector from an older build records nothing, so it
would otherwise read as "nothing running" while holding live webhooks — which is
exactly how the damage happened. Any `bin/connect` process the registry can't
account for is now called out by pid, with its paths marked unknown.

Genuine orphans clean themselves up. A run killed with `SIGKILL` never tears
down, so its entry stays behind with the paths it owned — and the next
`bin/connect` start deletes exactly those webhooks, on the projects and repos
*that* run watched rather than only the ones you are starting now, and forgets
the entry once every one of them is accounted for. A path nobody recorded is
never touched.

### Stopping (and why it matters)

While running, the connector exposes a **public URL** (via Tailscale Funnel) and
registers a **real webhook** on each watched project. **Always stop it when
you’re done** — stopping deletes every webhook and unmounts its funnel paths
automatically. In Claude Code, ending the skill does this; from a terminal, press
**Ctrl-C**. Nothing is left running or exposed.

While it runs, it also keeps those registrations alive. Basecamp **deactivates
a webhook after 10 failed deliveries** (`Webhook::DeliveryJob` in bc3: about
four to five hours of backoff), and says nothing — the registration stays listed, but
nothing is delivered to it again. A laptop asleep overnight, a Tailscale funnel
path that dropped, or a run whose every delivery answered `503` all end that
way, and the chat and boost pollers keep working through it, so the connector
looks healthy while every mention goes unheard. Every `--webhook-check` seconds
(default 300) the connector re-reads each webhook it registered and reactivates
any Basecamp switched off (or re-registers one deleted out from under it),
remounts any of its funnel paths the funnel has lost, and reports both loudly on
STDERR. The events of the gap itself are gone — bc3 does not redeliver past a
deactivation — so a `DEACTIVATED` line in the log is worth reading.

Deactivation is the loud failure; the quiet one is a **single delivery that never
arrived**. Basecamp records it (`response.code: 0` — the connection failed, the
funnel re-establishing or the network dropping for a second), leaves the webhook
active, and never mentions it again; the connector logs nothing, because it never
received the request. So the same check also **reconciles the delivery history**:
Basecamp keeps the last deliveries on each webhook, with the exact body it POSTed
and the code it got back, and any delivery of the last hour that did not answer
2xx is replayed through the very same pipeline a live delivery takes — same
authorization, same corroborating re-fetch, same per-event suppression, so a
recovered trigger fires exactly once even if Basecamp retries it too. Recoveries
are logged; a failed delivery older than that hour, or one whose time or body
can't be read, is **not** replayed, and says so in the log (`MISSED and NOT
recovered`) with the recording's URL, so you can hand it over yourself.

## How it works

```
  You, in Basecamp                  Your machine
  ────────────────                  ─────────────────────────────────────────
  "@Clawdito fix the      ┌───>   bin/connect  (the bridge, Ruby)

                                              │
                                              ▼
                          /basecamp-connect  (the driver, a Claude skill)
                                     • boosts the recording `On it!` as the agent (the ack)
                                     • resolves the local repo from the project
                                     • dispatches a background agent in that repo
                                       (which gathers context via the `basecamp` CLI)
                                     • replies on the card as the agent (--profile)
```

Two halves, deliberately separated:

1. **`bin/connect`** — the **bridge**. A small Ruby process: it opens the public
   endpoint, registers the webhooks, and does the *security-critical* filtering
   and verification. It emits only trusted events as NDJSON and touches nothing
   else.
2. **`/basecamp-connect`** — the **driver**. A Claude Code skill that runs the
   bridge, reads its output, acks each event with a boost as the agent, turns it
   into a background-agent task in the right repo, and posts the reply.

The bridge is dumb-and-safe; the driver is smart-and-contextual. You can run
`bin/connect` on its own to see exactly what would be dispatched.

**The bridge doesn't know or care what reads it.** It writes one trusted event
per line to STDOUT and stops there, so any agent that can run a process and read
its output can be the driver — the `basecamp` CLI does the replying, and it takes
a `--profile`, not an agent. The driver shipped here is a Claude Code skill
because that's what it was built against, not because the protocol needs one.

### One session per task (`--dispatch session`)

The arrangement above has one long-lived Claude session driving everything, which
means every task in the day shares one conversation. That session's context fills
with unrelated work, and the tasks can't be told apart from outside.

`--dispatch session` replaces the driver with a session *per thing of work*:

```
  "@Clawdito fix the      ┌───>   bin/connect --dispatch session
   calendar bug"   ──webhook┘        • …same filtering and verification…
                                     • boosts the recording as the agent (the ack)
                                     • resolves the repo from config/project_repos.toml
                                     • opens `claude --bg` for THIS card
                                              │
                                              ▼
                              one Claude session per card / message / todo
                                     • gathers its own context via the `basecamp` CLI
                                     • EnterWorktree + PR when it changes code
                                     • replies on the card as the agent
                                     • later comments on that card land in THIS session
```

Nothing has to be watching. The session is opened by the connector itself, in the
same code path that verified the event, and shows up in `claude agents` named
after the card.

**A session belongs to a card, not to a comment.** Comments don't open sessions —
they join the one their card, message, todo or document already owns. So the
card's description, every earlier comment, and everything the agent worked out
last time are all still in context when you follow up. Re-reading a card from
Basecamp recovers its text; it never recovers the reasoning.

Three consequences of having no model in the loop, all handled explicitly:

- **Nobody can be asked.** A project that maps to no repo in
  `config/project_repos.toml` is not guessed at — the event is held and the agent
  says so on the recording.
- **Nobody notices a failure.** A session that refuses to start is reported on the
  card, because silence there is indistinguishable from a missed mention.
- **Nobody can be interrupted.** A comment arriving while its session is mid-work
  waits in the registry and is delivered when the session finishes, rather than
  stopping it and discarding what it was doing.

A dispatched session never parks itself on a question, either. Nothing is watching
its terminal, so when it needs input it posts the question to Basecamp and ends its
turn; your answer arrives as a comment on the same card, lands in the same session,
and it picks up where it left off.

```bash
bin/connect @Clawdito --project "BC5 Calendar" --dispatch session
```

| Flag | Default | What it does |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `--dispatch stdout\|session` | `stdout` | `stdout` prints events and stops there (the original behaviour, unchanged). `session` also opens a session per thing of work. |
| `--session-permission-mode MODE` | `acceptEdits` | What dispatched sessions may do without asking. |
| `--session-model MODEL` | whatever `claude` uses | Model for dispatched sessions. |

STDOUT still carries every event under `--dispatch session`, so anything that
only *reads* the stream keeps working. **Don't run the `/basecamp-connect` skill
against it at the same time**, though: the skill dispatches every event it reads,
and the connector has already dispatched it, so each mention would get two
receipts, two workers and two replies. Pick one driver per connector.

> **Worth understanding before you turn this on.** Dispatched sessions run
> unattended at the permission mode you give them, which makes the trust boundary
> — only the operator's own comments trigger anything — the only thing between a
> Basecamp comment and a command running on your machine. That boundary is the
> same one the connector has always enforced, but until now a person was watching
> a terminal while it worked. Read *Trust & security model* below before widening
> trust past the default, and prefer `acceptEdits` over `bypassPermissions`.

Requires the `claude` CLI on `PATH`; the connector refuses to start without it
rather than discovering it at the first mention.

### Column moves (`--on-column-move`)

On a board where the column says what kind of work is wanted — plan it, build
it, review it — **moving the card is the instruction**. `--on-column-move` makes
that a trigger, so you drag a card into *In progress* and the agent picks it up
instead of you having to @mention it afterwards to say what the board already
says.

```bash
bin/connect @Clawdito --project "BC5 Calendar" --on-column-move
```

It is independent of how events are dispatched. The `/basecamp-connect` skill
handles moves under the default `--dispatch stdout`, and `--dispatch session`
handles them itself; both apply the rules below.

Basecamp calls a column change an *adoption* (`kanban_card_adopted`) — a card's
column is its parent — and the delivery names the destination column, so nothing
is polled and nothing is looked up.

**Moves into Done and Not-now columns never trigger.** bc3 marks both
structurally (`Kanban::DoneColumn`, `Kanban::NotNowColumn`), so this holds
however those columns are titled, renamed or translated. Carve out further
columns by title with `--column-move-except "Backlog"`.

**A move is acted on only for a card that is the agent's.** A move is the one
trigger that can arrive about a card nobody addressed to the agent — anyone's
card, dragged across a board it merely watches — so assignment is how the board
says a card is the agent's, and every emitted move carries `trigger.assigned`.
Under `--dispatch session` a move also drives a session the card already has,
since a card mid-conversation is exactly what a move is meant to push along.
Anything else is ignored and gets no receipt boost, so nothing on the card
implies somebody picked it up.

**The receipt goes on the move, not the card.** A card may be weeks old and
already carry boosts from earlier rounds, so a boost there wouldn't say *which*
move was picked up. bc3 lets the events in a card's history carry boosts too, so
the 👀 lands on the "moved this card to In progress" line itself.

**The session is told to leave the card where it is.** You chose that column
deliberately; moving it on would both override you and erase the signal. (A
mention still gets the usual "move it out of Triage" instruction.)

**It cannot loop.** The agent moves cards itself as work progresses — into *In
progress* when it starts, into *For Review* when a PR is open. Those moves are
authored by the agent, and every trust mode refuses the agent's own events, so a
gesture it made can never wake it again. Same mechanism that stops the reply
loop.

A move is treated as the same class of privilege as an assignment: operator-only
in every trust mode, since anyone who can see a board can drag a card across it.
`--allow-assignments-from-authorized` opts a broadened mode's authors into both
together.

---

## Security mechanisms

What `bin/connect` has in place, at a glance:

- **Operator-only triggering by default** — with no trust flags, an event acts
  only when its creator is the operator (the CLI default profile, or
  `--operator <profile>`), matched by email or account Person id (bc3 redacts
  other users' emails from non-admin viewers, so the id is the key that always
  works). Trust can be **deliberately broadened** per run — see
  [Trust modes](#trust-modes) below.
- **Agent-self exclusion** — the agent's own identity never authorizes, in any
  mode, matched by email *and* Person id. Even when trust is broadened to a
  domain or project the agent belongs to, its own posts cannot re-trigger it.
- **Assignments stay operator-only** — assigning the agent a card/todo is
  higher-privilege (the assigner's identity is not corroborated), so broadened
  modes apply to mentions only unless `--allow-assignments-from-authorized`
  explicitly opts assignments in.
- **Mention gating** — the recording must contain a real Basecamp mention
  *attachment* (`application/vnd.basecamp.mention`) for the agent user, matched by
  the agent's Person id encoded in the mention SGID. A mention typed into a
  **draft** counts from the moment the draft is published: Basecamp relays no
  event while a recording is drafted and never re-relays its creation once it
  goes live, so the publication (`*_active`) is the delivery the connector acts
  on — and a recording Basecamp still marks `drafted` never emits.
- **Subscription gating** — a new comment with *no* mention still triggers when
  the agent subscribes to the commented-on recording (a card/thread it
  participates in). Subscription is a live API fact, so it is confirmed by
  re-fetching the parent's subscribers and matching the agent's Person id — never
  taken from the payload. The comment author is gated exactly like a mention
  (operator by default, or the active trust mode's authors).
- **Boost gating** — a boost on the agent's work triggers only when a fresh
  fetch of the **agent's own received-boosts feed** contains it: boosts never
  arrive by webhook (polling that feed is the delivery mechanism), and the feed
  files a boost under the person it was aimed at, so membership is both the
  existence proof and the targeting proof. The booster is gated exactly like a
  mention author — matched by Person id, since the agent's view of the feed
  redacts other users' emails — and the emitted booster/content come from the
  fetch, never from a payload. Email-keyed trust modes (`allowlist`, `domain`)
  can't see through that redaction, so under them boosts effectively stay
  operator-only; `project` mode broadens boosts fine.
- **API corroboration** — every event is re-fetched from the Basecamp API and the
  **authoritative fetched copy is what gets acted on**, never the raw POST body.
  For a mention the fetched recording carries the authoritative creator *and*
  content, so both the author and the mention are re-checked against it. An
  assignment corroborates the agent's live assignee state but keeps the POST's
  claimed assigner — see the assignment caveat under [Trust modes](#trust-modes).
- **Secret webhook path** — the server accepts only `POST /bc5/<secret>`, where
  `<secret>` is a fresh 128-bit random token generated per run; every other path
  returns 404.
- **Localhost binding** — WEBrick listens only on `127.0.0.1`; the sole public
  ingress is the Tailscale Funnel over HTTPS.
- **Replay de-duplication** — events are de-duplicated by id within a run.
- **No reply loop** — the agent's own identity never authorizes in any mode (an
  explicit guard on email and Person id), so replies posted as the agent can't
  re-trigger the connector even under `domain`/`project` trust where the agent
  shares the domain or is a project member; in operator mode they also simply
  fail the author check. Startup refuses to run if the agent and operator
  resolve to the same user.
- **Ephemeral exposure** — the funnel and per-project webhooks exist only while
  the process runs and are torn down on exit.

## Trust & security model

A webhook payload is attacker-influenceable text that flows into an agent which
can run commands. `bin/connect` emits an event only when **all** of these hold:

1. **Authored by an authorized user.** By default that means *you* alone (the
   CLI default profile, or `--operator <profile>`), matched by email or account
   Person id: a third party who can comment in the project cannot make your
   agent do anything.
   Trust modes (below) can deliberately extend this to named colleagues, a
   domain, or the whole project membership — and for a **mention** the check is
   applied **twice**: once on the claimed webhook payload as a cheap pre-filter,
   and again on the corroborated event, so authorization binds to the author
   Basecamp actually recorded, never to forgeable POST text. (An **assignment**
   corroborates the agent's assignee state but not the assigner — see the
   assignment caveat under [Trust modes](#trust-modes).)
2. **Targets the agent.** The event must reach the agent one of five ways:
   a real Basecamp mention *attachment* (`application/vnd.basecamp.mention`)
   naming it (not loose text that happens to contain the name); an assignment
   adding it to a card/todo; a **new comment on a recording the agent
   subscribes to**; a **boost on the agent's work**; or — only with
   `--on-column-move` — a **card moved into another column**, which targets by
   the board rather than by name (see
   [Column moves](#column-moves---on-column-move)). Mentions are re-checked
   on the corroborated recording, so a forged mention paired with a real
   un-mentioning recording is dropped; subscription is re-fetched from the live
   subscribers API and stamped by the verifier, so a comment the agent doesn't
   actually subscribe to is dropped the same way; a boost is stamped only when
   the verifier finds it in a fresh fetch of the agent's own received-boosts
   feed — the feed files a boost under the person it was aimed at, so
   membership is the targeting fact.
3. **Corroborated by Basecamp.** The recording is re-fetched from the Basecamp
   API and confirmed. For a mention that means it exists **with the claimed
   creator and the claimed mention** — so a forged POST cannot survive. For an
   assignment it means the agent is really among the recording's current
   assignees; the assigner's identity is not independently corroborated, so
   there the secret URL path — a fresh 128-bit token per run — is the gate that
   stops a forged operator-assignment, not corroboration. For a **column move**
   it means the move itself is found in **the card's own event history**: the
   webhook's id must be a real adoption there, into the claimed column, and the
   author and columns acted on are read from that record, not the POST. So a
   forged move — even one claiming the column the card already sits in — has
   nothing to match. The card must also still be in that column, since a move
   since undone or superseded no longer describes the board.

For a mention, the content acted on is the **authoritative copy fetched from
Basecamp**, never the raw POST body.

**No reply loop.** Replies are posted *as the agent*, a different user than the
operator. The agent's own identity **never authorizes, in any mode** — an
explicit guard, matched by email and Person id, refuses agent-authored events
before any mode is consulted. So even under `--trust domain` (where the agent's
email may share the domain) or `--trust project` (where the agent is a member),
its own replies can never re-trigger the connector. (`bin/connect` refuses to
start if the agent and operator resolve to the same Basecamp user — a
configuration in which nothing can trigger. The usual cause is `BASECAMP_PROFILE`
pinned to the agent's profile with no `--operator`: the CLI resolves an
unflagged call through that variable before the default profile, so the
operator becomes the agent.)

### Trust modes

Who may drive the agent is a per-run, explicit choice. The agent acts with the
operator's full machine authority, so broadening trust means handing that
authority to more people — the startup log prints the active mode and the
concrete allowed set so it is never implicit.

| Mode | Who triggers | CLI | Keyed on |
|------|--------------|-----|----------|
| `operator` *(default)* | You only. No flags = exactly this. | — | your email **or** Person id |
| `allowlist` | You + the named emails. | `--allow marie@37signals.com` (repeatable or comma-separated; implies the mode, or `--trust allowlist`) | the author's email |
| `domain` | Any author whose email is at a listed domain. | `--allow-domain 37signals.com` (repeatable), or bare `--trust domain` for the 37signals.com default | the author's email |
| `project` | Any corroborated non-client author of a recording the operator's account can read (client users excluded, fail-closed). | `--allow-project` or `--trust project` | the author's Person id |

**The `Keyed on` column decides whether a mode can fire at all.** Basecamp shows
a person's real email address only to themselves and to account admins —
`Person::Ability#can_see_email_address_of?` is `self == person || admin?`. Every
trust decision is re-made on the recording the verifier re-fetches with *your*
CLI profile, so unless you are an admin on that account, a colleague's address
arrives masked:

```
$ basecamp show <a colleague's message> --json | jq .data.creator
{ "id": 51659243, "name": "Rob Zolkos", "email_address": "r••••••••@•••.•••", "client": false }
```

`allowlist` compares that string against the email you listed and never matches.
`domain` parses `•••.•••` out of it as the domain and never matches. Both fail
closed and silently — the event is simply dropped as unauthorized, with no hint
that a masked address is why. As an account admin you see real addresses and both
modes work as written.

`project` is keyed on the Person id, which every viewer can see, so it works
regardless of admin status. It is also the loosest of the three — read the limit
below before choosing it.

Every mode implicitly includes the operator and excludes the agent itself. In
`project` mode, membership is proven by corroboration: only project members can
post in a project, and every event is re-fetched from the Basecamp API before it
acts — a person who cannot post there cannot produce a corroborated recording.
**Client (external) users are excluded fail-closed**: the corroborated recording
must positively report `creator.client == false`; an absent or non-boolean flag
is treated as untrusted, so a recording representation that omits it cannot slip
a client author through.

One limit of `project` mode is worth stating plainly, because it matters only
against the forged-POST-with-leaked-secret-path threat (a normal Basecamp
delivery is unaffected): **corroboration proves the recording exists with that
author, not that it lives in a *watched* project.** The API re-fetch follows the
URL in the payload, and the operator's CLI can read recordings beyond the
watched projects. So `project` mode trusts any corroborated non-client author in
*any* project the operator's account can see, not strictly the watched ones.
Prefer `allowlist`/`domain` when you need the trust set pinned to specific
people.

**Assignments are operator-only in every mode** unless
`--allow-assignments-from-authorized` opts the mode's authors in. An assignment
is corroborated by the agent really being among the card's assignees — but the
*assigner's* identity is **not** independently verifiable: the verifier confirms
live assignee state and preserves the event's claimed creator. Against a forged
POST on a leaked secret path, that means the "operator-only" guarantee for the
assignment trigger rests on the secret path, not on corroboration, in a way the
mention trigger does not. Bear that in mind before opting assignments in, and
prefer the mention trigger when the author must be cryptographically pinned to
the recording.

## Internal command: `bin/connect`

The bridge. Run it directly to watch a project and print trusted events; the
skill runs exactly this under the hood.

```bash
bin/connect @Clawdito --project "BC5 Calendar"
bin/connect @Clawdito --project "BC5 Calendar" --project "HEY Triage"
bin/connect @Clawdito --project Queenbee --operator jorge --port 4567
```

| Argument / flag | Meaning | Default |
|-----------------|---------|---------|
| `@AGENT` | Agent user / local `basecamp` profile to watch for and reply as. Leading `@` optional; lowercased to the profile name. **Required**, validated at startup. | — |
| `--project` | Basecamp project name, URL, or ID. **Required**, repeatable. | — |
| `--operator` | Profile whose user is allowed to trigger. Also the profile every call not made as the agent runs under — corroborating fetches, chat polling, webhook registration. | CLI default profile |
| `--gh-operator` | GitHub login the review loop is about (with `--repo`): reviews on pull requests opened by anyone else are dropped, and only this login's `approved` reviews are actionable. Any other reviewer's `approved` review is dropped; `changes_requested` and `commented` pass from anyone. The one exception: a `commented` review by *that* login whose body and every inline comment start with 🤖 is the dispatched agent's own reply and is dropped — anything written in it without the marker, and it passes like anyone else's. | the login `gh` is authenticated as |
| `--trust` | Trust mode: `operator`, `allowlist`, `project`, or `domain`. Usually inferred from the value flags below. | `operator` |
| `--allow` | Author email to trust (repeatable or comma-separated). Implies `--trust allowlist`. | — |
| `--allow-domain` | Email domain to trust (repeatable or comma-separated). Implies `--trust domain`. | `37signals.com` under bare `--trust domain` |
| `--allow-project` | Trust any corroborated non-client author of a recording the operator's account can read. Implies `--trust project`. | off |
| `--allow-assignments-from-authorized` | Let any authorized author trigger via assignment, not just the operator. | off — assignments are operator-only |
| `--types` | Comma-separated Basecamp event types to subscribe to. `Chat::Line` selects Campfire coverage — chat has no webhooks, so the connector polls each watched project's chats for it. | `Comment,Message,Kanban::Card,Kanban::Step,Todo,Chat::Line` |
| `--chat-poll` | Campfire poll interval, in seconds. | `15` |
| `--boost-poll` | Received-boosts poll interval, in seconds. Boosts have no webhooks, so the connector polls the agent's own received-boosts feed for them. | `60` |
| `--no-boosts` | Don't poll the agent's received-boosts feed (no boost trigger). | polling on |
| `--webhook-check` | How often, in seconds, to re-check that each registered webhook is still active and its funnel path still mounted, putting back whichever isn't, and to reconcile each webhook's delivery history so a delivery that never arrived is replayed. Basecamp deactivates a webhook after 10 failed deliveries. | `300` |
| `--on-column-move` | Let moving a card into another column trigger the agent, on a board where the column says what work is wanted. Moves into Done and Not-now columns never trigger; a move drives a session the card already has, but opens a new one only if the agent is an assignee. Works under either `--dispatch` mode. See [Column moves](#column-moves---on-column-move). | off |
| `--column-move-except` | Also never trigger on a move into this column, by title (repeatable or comma-separated). Implies `--on-column-move`. Done and Not-now columns are already excluded by type. | — |
| `--dispatch` | What to do with a verified event. `stdout` prints it and stops there, for a watching driver to act on. `session` also opens one Claude session per card/message/todo and needs no watcher — see [One session per task](#one-session-per-task---dispatch-session). | `stdout` |
| `--session-permission-mode` | Permission mode for dispatched sessions (`--dispatch session` only). They run unattended, so this is what they may do without asking. | `acceptEdits` |
| `--session-model` | Model for dispatched sessions (`--dispatch session` only). | whatever `claude` is configured to use |
| `--port` | Local port for the webhook server. | an unused high port |

**What it does, in order:**

1. **Resolve agent & operator.** Validates the agent name maps to a usable local
   profile (`basecamp me --profile <agent>`); if not, it aborts with
   `Run basecamp auth login --profile <agent>…`. Resolves the operator identity
   (refreshing an expired token once). Warns if agent == operator. With
   `--repo`, also resolves the operator's GitHub login (`gh api user`, or
   `--gh-operator`) — the author of the pull requests whose reviews are
   emitted, the only reviewer whose approvals are emitted, and the login whose all-🤖
   comment reviews are dropped as the agent's own replies — and aborts with `Run gh auth login, or pass --gh-operator LOGIN` if it
   can't.
2. **Open the endpoint.** Starts a WEBrick server on `127.0.0.1:<port>` that only
   accepts `POST /bc5/<random-secret>`; everything else is 404. One server + one
   secret path serves every watched project.
3. **Expose it.** `tailscale funnel --set-path` mounts each of the connector's
   paths (`/bc5/<secret>`, plus `/gh/<secret>` when watching repos) on this
   host's funnel, publishing the server at a public `https://<host>.ts.net` URL.
   Only those paths are touched, so funnel paths other tools mounted keep
   working.
4. **Register webhooks.** Creates one webhook per project (with retry on transient
   failures), recording their IDs for cleanup. Also starts the **boost poller**
   (unless `--no-boosts`): boosts have no webhooks, so the agent's own
   received-boosts feed is fetched every `--boost-poll` seconds and each new
   boost runs the same pipeline as a webhook delivery. The first fetch is a
   baseline — history is never dispatched.
5. **Listen.** For each delivery, on the request thread: pre-filter
   (authorized author + mentions agent + actionable kind), de-duplicate by
   event id, verify against the Basecamp API, re-check that the
   **corroborated** author is authorized, and **print the trusted event as one
   line of NDJSON** to STDOUT. Dropped/diagnostic lines go to STDERR. The
   delivery is answered with the verdict: `200` once the event is settled
   (emitted, dropped, or a duplicate), `503` when Basecamp could not be asked —
   the connector re-runs the CLI a few times first (its keyring probe loses a
   race under concurrent invocations and reports stale credentials; bc3 may
   answer 5xx mid-deploy), and a `503` makes bc3's delivery job redeliver the
   event with backoff rather than settling it as uncorroborated. Which
   failures count as the CLI's plight rather than Basecamp's answer is a
   fixed list of codes and messages (`Client::TRANSIENT_CODES`,
   `TRANSIENT_API_ERROR`), widened by the `retryable` field of the CLI's
   `-j` error envelope from the release that adds it (pending in
   basecamp-cli): a failure stamped `retryable: true` is retried whatever
   its code, while `false` — the CLI's stamp for its verdicts and for
   anything it never classified, the keyring race included — leaves the list
   in force. A delivery that stays unanswerable for all of bc3's 10 attempts
   (~4.3h — a revoked credential looks just like the race) makes bc3
   deactivate the webhook. The webhook check (`--webhook-check`, see
   [Stopping](#stopping-and-why-it-matters)) reactivates it within one
   interval, but a credential still broken just fails the next ten deliveries
   too: fix it (`basecamp auth status --profile <agent>`). The connector logs
   that remedy with every `503`.

**Emitted event (STDOUT, one JSON object per line):**

```json
{"event_id":99001,"kind":"comment_created","created_at":"…",
 "creator":{"id":100,"name":"Jorge Manrubia","email_address":"jorge@…"},
 "recording":{"id":456,"type":"Comment","app_url":"…","url":"…",
   "content":"<p>… <bc-attachment content-type=\"application/vnd.basecamp.mention\">…Clawdito…</bc-attachment> fix X</p>",
   "parent":{…},"bucket":{"id":222,"name":"BC5 Calendar"}},
 "trigger":{"mentioned":true,"subscribed":false}}
```

`trigger` is the connector's own verdict on why the event targets the agent,
settled on the re-fetched recording: `mentioned` when its content carries a
mention attachment for the agent's Person id, `subscribed` when a
`comment_created` fired because the agent subscribes to the commented-on
recording. A `comment_created` is exactly one of the two. An assignment or a
boost is a directive by `kind` alone: `subscribed` is `false` for both, and
`mentioned` is a fact about the content (an assigned card whose description
mentions the agent reads `true`; a boost is a reaction, not content, so the
boost path settles no mention verdict and it always reads `false`). A watcher
reads `trigger` to tell a directive from
followed-thread activity instead of decoding the mention markup itself.

**Teardown.** On `SIGINT`/`SIGTERM` it deletes **every** registered webhook
(best-effort, reporting any it couldn’t) and unmounts its own funnel paths
(`tailscale funnel --set-path <path> off` — never `funnel reset`, which would
also tear down other tools' paths), then stops the server. The mounted paths and
webhooks live only for the lifetime of the process. If it
is ever `SIGKILL`ed, clean up manually:

```bash
basecamp webhooks list   --project "<project>"        # find leftovers
basecamp webhooks delete <id> --project "<project>"
tailscale funnel status                              # find leftover /bc5/… and /gh/… paths
tailscale funnel --set-path /bc5/<secret> off
```

### Useful `basecamp` CLI commands

```bash
basecamp me [--profile <name>]                         # who a profile is
basecamp webhooks list   --project "<project>" -j      # webhooks on a project
basecamp comment <recording-url> "…" --profile <agent> # post as the agent
```

---

## Configuration

- **Agent profile** — a local `basecamp` CLI profile authenticated as the agent
  user. The mention target *and* the reply identity (`basecamp comment …
  --profile <agent>`).
- **Operator** — the user allowed to trigger; defaults to the CLI default
  profile, override with `--operator <profile>`. Must differ from the agent.
  Every call not made as the agent is made under this profile, so
  `--operator` also decides whose credentials corroborate events and register
  webhooks — a `BASECAMP_PROFILE` in the environment does not.
- **Trust mode** — who beyond the operator may trigger; defaults to nobody.
  See [Trust modes](#trust-modes).
- **Project → repo mapping** — [`config/project_repos.toml`](config/project_repos.toml)
  maps Basecamp project-name tokens to local repo paths. The skill uses it to
  decide where to run each agent; if nothing matches, it asks you.
- **Event types** — `--types` (default `Comment,Message,Kanban::Card,Kanban::Step,Todo,Chat::Line`).
  `Chat::Line` is Campfire coverage: Basecamp delivers no chat webhooks, so the
  connector polls each watched project's chats and runs new lines through the
  same trust gate as webhook events. A watched project with chat disabled says
  so once and is then left out of the poll for the rest of the run; restart to
  re-check it.
- **Boost polling** — `--boost-poll` interval in seconds (default 60), or
  `--no-boosts` to disable the boost trigger. Boosts have no webhooks, so the
  connector polls the agent's own received-boosts feed — an account-wide,
  agent-scoped surface (a boost triggers wherever the agent's boosted work
  lives, not only in watched projects).
- **Webhook check** — `--webhook-check` interval in seconds (default 300):
  how often each registered webhook is re-read and reactivated if Basecamp
  deactivated it, the funnel paths remounted if lost, and each webhook's
  delivery history reconciled so a delivery that never arrived is replayed
  (within a one-hour lookback; anything older is logged, not replayed).
- **Port** — `--port` (default: an unused high port).

## Development

```bash
bin/setup                 # or: bundle install
bundle exec rake test     # minitest suite
bundle exec rubocop       # 37signals house style
```

The code is a small [Zeitwerk](https://github.com/fxn/zeitwerk)-autoloaded gem
under `lib/basecamp_agent_connector/`. Transport-agnostic pieces live at the top
level; the two transports are namespaced under `Basecamp::` and `GitHub::`.
External commands (`basecamp`, `gh`, `tailscale`) are reached through an
injectable **command runner**, so the test suite stubs that one subprocess
boundary rather than mocking the gem’s own classes.
