# The Claude Code CLI, as much of it as dispatching sessions needs.
#
# Two things about it shape this class, both established against the real CLI
# rather than assumed:
#
#   1. `--background` picks the session's id itself and *ignores* `--session-id`
#      ("warning: --bg manages the session id"). So the id cannot be chosen up
#      front; it has to be read back. The id is printed on a line meant for a
#      human — `backgrounded · 1e9694b6 · Re: a card`, wrapped in colour codes —
#      and the short form it prints is the first segment of the session's full
#      uuid.
#   2. `--resume` given that short id starts a *copy* under a new id, and says
#      so: "To continue a session under its own id, pass its full session id".
#      A copy would silently give one card two sessions, which is the exact
#      failure dispatching per task exists to prevent — so the full uuid is
#      what gets stored, and it is looked up once, at spawn, while the session
#      is certain to be listed.
