# Decides which Basecamp users may drive the agent. The operator always may;
# each mode extends trust to a further set of authors. Every mode refuses the
# agent's own identity outright — matched by email and by Person id — so the
# agent can never trigger itself no matter how broadly trust is opened (a
# domain the agent's email shares, a project it is a member of).
#
# Assignment events are higher-privilege (assigning the agent a card runs it
# against that card, and the assigner's identity is not corroborated by the
# verifier), so broadened modes apply to mentions only: assignments stay
# operator-only unless `allow_assignments:` opts the mode's authors in.
#
# The pipeline consults `authorizes?` twice: on the claimed webhook payload as
# a cheap pre-filter, and again on the verified event so the decision binds to
# the authoritative creator fetched from Basecamp, not to forgeable POST text.

  # agent and die on the first branch, so a board gesture it made can never
