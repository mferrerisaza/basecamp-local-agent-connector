  # Returns whether the event reached a verdict (emitted, dropped, ignored,
  # or a duplicate). False means Basecamp did not corroborate it — the
  # recording is gone, or never existed — in which case the id is forgotten
  # so a redelivery gets a fresh attempt, since re-verifying is idempotent.
  # When Basecamp could not be asked at all (Client::TransientError, after
  # the client's own retries) that error propagates with the id likewise
  # forgotten: the caller decides how to defer — a webhook answers 503 so
  # Basecamp redelivers, a poller retries on its next tick — and must not
  # record a verdict, because there is none.
  #
  # Verdicts are per event id, so that "seen" always means settled: an id is
  # claimed while its verification is in flight and stays seen once it
  # settled. Deliveries arrive on concurrent server threads, and a
  # verification that overruns bc3's 10s delivery timeout is redelivered
  # while the original is still in flight; unsynchronized, the redelivery
  # would find the id seen, be answered 200 as a duplicate, and then the
  # original could fail and forget the id — with nobody left to redeliver.
  # So a delivery of an id in flight waits for that id's verdict (see
  # `claim`) and finds either a settled id (a duplicate) or a forgotten one
  # (a fresh attempt). Distinct ids never wait on each other: each
  # verification shells out to the CLI, and a burst serialized behind one
  # slow verification would time out delivery after delivery. The pollers
  # each own a pipeline and poll from a single thread, so they never wait.

  # delivery of an event that did arrive by another delivery is neither
  # replayed nor reported as a hole.
  #
  # An id still being verified has no verdict yet, so this waits for that
  # verification to settle, as `claim` does, and answers on the outcome. A
