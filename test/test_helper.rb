# The run registry's default directory is the operator's own

# connectors are running on this machine, and which funnel paths a dead one
# abandoned. This suite starts real connectors, so left on that default it
# reads those records, writes one of its own under the test process's pid, and
# — on any sweep that gets as far as succeeding — discards the entry naming a
# dead run's webhooks, which is the only record of them there is. It also makes
# the suite's result depend on whether the operator happens to have a connector
# running: with one alive there is nothing abandoned to sweep and the suite is
# green; the moment one dies without tearing down, five connector tests walk
# into sweep calls their fakes never stubbed. The whole test process gets a
# throwaway directory instead, so no test can reach the real one by forgetting
# to pass a registry.
