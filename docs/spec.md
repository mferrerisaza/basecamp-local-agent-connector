# basecamp-local-agent-connector — Spec

## Purpose

Manage local coding agents from Basecamp. This project bridges Basecamp
webhooks to local agents: you write a comment / message / card in
Basecamp that @mentions a real agent user (e.g. `@Clawdito`), and a background
agent running on your machine picks it up, gathers context from Basecamp,
acts on it, and replies as that agent user.

The bridge has two halves:

1. **`bin/connect`** — a Ruby process that exposes a local webhook
   server to the internet (via Tailscale Funnel), registers it as a Basecamp
   webhook, filters + verifies incoming events, and prints trusted events to
   STDOUT.
2. **`/basecamp-connect` skill** — a Claude Code skill that runs the script, watches its
   STDOUT, acknowledges each **directive** event — a mention, an assignment, a
   Campfire line — with an `On it!` boost as the agent within seconds of
   receipt, and hands every trusted event to an in-session background agent
   that gathers the Basecamp context and does the work.

## Why this shape

Basecamp is an excellent place to *capture context* — a comment lives inside a
card, inside a project, with a creator, a thread, and linked recordings. Rather
than re-typing context into an agent, you write where the work already lives and
let the agent pull the surrounding context from Basecamp. The webhook payload is
treated as a *notification + pointer*, not as a source of truth (see Security).

## Identity model (the trust boundary)

The connector distinguishes **two** Basecamp users:

- **Agent** — a real Basecamp user (e.g. `@Clawdito`) backed by a **local
  `basecamp` CLI profile** of the same name. It is the **mention target** (the
  connector only fires when this user is @mentioned) and the **reply identity**
  (replies post as it via `--profile <agent>`). The agent name is passed as the
  positional argument; the connector **validates the profile exists locally at
  startup** (`basecamp me --profile <agent>`) and aborts with setup guidance if
  not.
- **Operator** — the user allowed to *trigger* the agent. This is the
  anti-prompt-injection boundary: only events authored by the operator are acted
  on, so a third party who can comment cannot inject instructions. Defaults to
  the `basecamp` CLI default profile; override with `--operator <profile>`.

The agent must be a **different** user than the operator. Because replies are
posted as the agent, and the trust filter requires the *operator* to be the
author, agent replies are never re-ingested — this is the structural fix for the
reply feedback loop. The connector refuses to start if the two resolve to the
same user.

The author match is keyed on **email address or account Person id** — either
identifies the author. Basecamp has two id spaces — a webhook's `creator.id`
is an account-scoped **Person** id, while `basecamp me` returns a global
**identity** id; they differ for the same human — so the connector resolves
both the email and the account Person id for each identity at startup. Email
alone is not enough: bc3 **redacts other users' email addresses from
non-admin viewers** (`Person#can_see_email_address_of?` is self-or-admin), so
a feed fetched as the (non-admin) agent shows every other author as
`j••••@••••.•••` — there the Person id is the only usable key. The mention
match looks for a mention attachment (`application/vnd.basecamp.mention`)
whose SGID carries the agent's Person id — never the display name, which is
not unique.

## Project structure (rubygem layout)

The Ruby server and its supporting code are organized as a proper gem so logic
lives in `lib/` (testable, requireable) and `bin/` holds only thin executables.

The `/basecamp-connect` skill is itself a deliverable: a `SKILL.md` under `skills/basecamp-connect/`
(Claude Code project-skill format — YAML frontmatter with `name`, `description`,
trigger keywords, then the instructions). It is the human/agent entry point that
runs `bin/connect`, watches its STDOUT, and dispatches background agents per the
behavior in Component 2. Discovery follows the standard Claude Code mechanism
(e.g. a `.claude/skills` symlink to `skills/`).

- **Top-level module**: `BasecampAgentConnector`. Each file above defines one
  class/module under that namespace (e.g. `BasecampAgentConnector::Server`).
- **`bin/connect`** is a minimal shim — it adds `lib/` to the load path, requires
  `basecamp_agent_connector`, and calls `BasecampAgentConnector::Basecamp::CLI.start(ARGV)`.
  All real logic lives in `lib/` so it is unit-testable without spawning the
  process.
- **Runtime dependencies**: stdlib only (`webrick`, `json`, `securerandom`,
  `open3` for shelling out to `basecamp`/`tailscale`). Dev dependencies
  (minitest, rubocop) live in the Gemfile.
- The gem is not intended for publication to RubyGems.org — the structure is for
  organization and testability, run locally from a clone.

---

## Component 1: `bin/connect`

### Invocation

```
bin/connect @AGENT --project <project>... [--operator <profile>] [--types <types>] [--boost-poll <seconds>|--no-boosts] [--webhook-check <seconds>] [--port <port>]
```

- `@AGENT` — the agent user / local profile name (e.g. `@Clawdito` or
  `clawdito`; the leading `@` is optional, lowercased to the profile name).
  Required. Validated against local profiles at startup.
- `--project` — Basecamp project (name, URL, or ID). **Required and repeatable.**
  Basecamp webhooks are per-project and there is **no account-level/global
  webhook** in the API, so at least one project must be named. The `basecamp`
  CLI resolves a project name or URL to its ID under the hood, so you can pass
  `--project "Queenbee"` directly.
- `--operator` — profile whose user is allowed to trigger (default: CLI default
  profile).
- `--types` — optional comma-separated Basecamp event types
  (default: `Comment, Message, Kanban::Card, Kanban::Step, Todo, Chat::Line`).
  `Chat::Line` selects Campfire coverage: bc3 excludes chat kinds from webhook
  relay entirely, so the bridge covers chat with an integrated poller (interval
  `--chat-poll`, default 15s) that runs each new line through the same
  authorizer + corroboration pipeline as webhook deliveries.
- `--boost-poll` / `--no-boosts` — boosts have no webhooks (a Boost is not a
  Recording and creates no Event in bc3), so the bridge polls the **agent's own
  received-boosts feed** (`/my/boosts.json`) for them on this interval (default
  60s); `--no-boosts` disables the boost trigger.
- `--webhook-check` — how often (default 300s) each registered webhook is
  re-read and reactivated if bc3 deactivated it (which it does, silently,
  after 10 failed deliveries — `Webhook::DeliveryJob`), and the run's funnel
  paths remounted if the funnel lost them. The same tick reconciles each
  webhook's `recent_deliveries`: any delivery inside a one-hour lookback whose
  `response.code` is not 2xx is replayed, body and all, through the webhook
  pipeline (same gates, same suppression, so at most one emission per event
  id); an older one, or one whose attempt time or recorded body cannot be
  read, is logged as an unrecovered hole instead.
- `--port` — local port for the Ruby server (default: an unused high port).

### Startup sequence

1. **Resolve agent + operator** — validate the agent name maps to a usable local
   profile (`basecamp me --profile <agent>`); if not, exit with guidance to run
   `basecamp auth login --profile <agent>`. Resolve the operator identity
   (default profile, or `--operator`). If a token is expired, attempt `basecamp
   auth refresh` once before failing (no `login` attempted automatically). Exit
   if agent and operator resolve to the same user (nothing could trigger).
2. **Resolve projects** — the explicit `--project` list (required). Names/URLs
   are resolved to IDs by the `basecamp` CLI when registering. This is the
   project set to subscribe.
3. **Start the local HTTP server** — a minimal **WEBrick** (Ruby stdlib, zero
   dependencies) server on `127.0.0.1:<port>` accepting `POST /bc5/<secret>`.
   A random unguessable path segment is generated per run (defense-in-depth; see
   Security). All other paths return 404. **One server + one funnel + one secret
   path serve every project**; the payload's `recording.bucket.id` identifies
   which project an event came from. A chat-only run (`--types` reduces to
   chat entries alone) mounts **no** `/bc5` route at all — there is no inbound
   ingress to expose or forge.
4. **Expose via Tailscale Funnel** — `tailscale funnel <port>` publishes the
   server on the public internet at a stable `*.ts.net` HTTPS URL. `serve`
   (tailnet-only) is insufficient — Basecamp's servers must reach the endpoint,
   so `funnel` (public) is required. **Skipped entirely when nothing mounts an
   inbound path** (chat-only): no funnel, and no Tailscale requirement.
5. **Start the Campfire poller** — chat-typed `--types` entries start the
   integrated poller: discover each project's chats synchronously (so the
   readiness log reports the room count), then fetch on the `--chat-poll`
   interval from a background thread. The first fetch baselines: lines
   predating the poller are marked seen, later ones process as live — and
   nothing emits before the connector reports readiness. Runs before webhook
   registration so discovery never widens the register-to-listen window.
6. **Register webhooks** — for **each** project in the set, `basecamp webhooks
   create <funnel-url>/bc5/<secret> --project <project> --types <webhook types>`
   — the **webhook-eligible** types only; chat-typed entries went to the poller,
   and Basecamp would reject them. Skipped when no webhook types remain. Capture
   every created webhook ID for cleanup. Surface per-project registration
   failures without aborting the rest. Then start the **boost poller** (unless
   `--no-boosts`): it fetches nothing until its first interval pass, well after
   the readiness lines print, so no event can beat the funnel's consumer to the
   stream.
7. **Listen** — for each incoming POST, run the pipeline below on the request
   thread and answer with its verdict: **200 OK** once the event is settled
   (emitted, dropped, or a duplicate — Basecamp must not redeliver those),
   **503** when Basecamp could not be asked, so its delivery job redelivers the
   event with backoff (bc3 retries any non-2xx delivery). Only a transient CLI
   failure that outlasts the client's own retries — the keyring-probe race
   under concurrent CLI invocations, a token refresh that lost that race, a
   network blip, bc3 answering 5xx, the CLI's open circuit breaker, garbled
   output — earns a 503; Basecamp's own refusal (not found, forbidden) is a
   verdict. The two are told apart by a fixed list of codes and messages,
   which the `retryable` field of the CLI's `-j` error envelope (from the
   release that adds it, pending in basecamp-cli) widens but never narrows:
   `true` is retried whatever the code, `false` — the CLI's stamp for its
   verdicts and for anything it never classified, the keyring race included
   — falls through to the list. A delivery that stays unanswerable for all
   10 of bc3's attempts
   (~4.3h; a revoked credential is indistinguishable from the race) gets the
   webhook deactivated, silently on bc3's side — the 503 log line names the
   remedy: fix the CLI's credentials and restart `bin/connect`, which
   re-registers.

### Event pipeline

For each delivered event:

1. **Cheap pre-filter** (on the raw payload, no API calls):
   - Path matches the secret path.
   - `kind` is a `*_created`, `*_content_changed`, `*_active` or
     `*_assignment_changed` event (edits that add the mention count; `*_active`
     is a draft being published — see below).
   - `creator.email_address` matches the **operator** (case-insensitive). Email,
     not id — a webhook's `creator.id` is an account-scoped Person id while
     `basecamp me` returns a global identity id; the email bridges them.
   - The event **targets the agent** — its content `@mentions` the agent (a
     mention attachment carrying the person's SGID, not literal `@name` text), or
     it assigns the agent, or it is a `comment_created` (which may target the
     agent by subscription; that can't be judged from the payload, so comments
     are admitted here and decided at verification).
2. **Dedup** — drop the event if its `event.id` has already been seen (in-memory
   set; at-least-once delivery means duplicates are expected). An id counts as
   seen once it reaches a verdict; an event Basecamp did not corroborate is
   forgotten again so a redelivery (or, for chat and boosts, the next poll)
   retries it — re-verifying is idempotent. An event Basecamp could not be
   asked about (the corroborating fetch failed transiently, even after the
   CLI client's retries) is forgotten the same way and, for a webhook,
   answered 503 so the redelivery actually comes.
3. **Authoritative verification** (the real trust gate): re-fetch the recording
   from Basecamp via the CLI (`basecamp show <recording.url|app_url>` /
   `basecamp ... -j`) and confirm it **actually exists** with the claimed creator
   and content. A forged POST (the funnel URL is public, Basecamp sends no
   signature) cannot survive this — if Basecamp doesn't corroborate the event, it
   is discarded. The payload's content field is never trusted directly; the
   fetched content is authoritative. The mention match against the agent's
   Person id is also settled on that fetched content and stamped onto the
   authoritative event as `agent_mentioned`, which is what the emitted
   `trigger.mentioned` reports. For a **comment on a subscribed recording**,
   verification additionally re-fetches the parent's subscribers
   (`basecamp subscriptions show`) and stamps the agent's membership onto the
   authoritative event, so the subscription that triggers is the live one
   Basecamp reports, not a claim in the POST. For a **boost** there is no
   recording endpoint to re-fetch (a boost is not a Recording): verification
   re-fetches the **agent's own received-boosts feed** and requires the claimed
   boost id to be present with the claimed booster — the emitted booster,
   content, and boosted recording all come from that fresh fetch, and presence
   in the feed doubles as the targeting fact (stamped `agent_boosted`). The
   webhook route refuses boost-kind payloads outright: Basecamp never delivers
   them, so the poller is the sole boost source. Verification also refuses any
   recording Basecamp still marks `drafted`: bc3 relays no event for a drafted
   recording (`Webhook.eligible_event?` — "don't leak drafts"), so a delivery
   naming one is a forgery, and a draft is visible to nobody but its author.
4. **Emit** — print one NDJSON line to STDOUT with the verified event (see
   format below). Non-matching / unverified events are dropped (logged to
   STDERR).

### Shutdown (SIGINT / SIGTERM)

Tear everything down — no orphaned public endpoints or stale Basecamp webhooks:

1. Delete **every** registered webhook (one per watched project) via
   `basecamp webhooks delete`. Best-effort: keep deleting the rest even if one
   fails, and report any that couldn't be removed.
2. Stop the Tailscale Funnel for our port (`tailscale funnel reset` / scoped off).
3. Stop the WEBrick server.

The funnel + webhooks live only for the lifetime of the process; each run
re-registers fresh.

### Emitted STDOUT format

One JSON object per line (NDJSON), built from the **verified** recording:

```json
{
  "event_id": 99001,
  "kind": "comment_created",
  "created_at": "2026-06-28T12:00:00Z",
  "creator": { "id": 123, "name": "Clawdito", "email_address": "clawdito@37signals.com" },
  "recording": {
    "id": 456,
    "type": "Comment",
    "title": "...",
    "app_url": "https://3.basecamp.com/000/buckets/222/comments/456",
    "url": "https://3.basecamp.com/000/buckets/222/comments/456.json",
    "content": "<p>Hey <bc-attachment content-type=\"application/vnd.basecamp.mention\">…Clawdito…</bc-attachment> please ...</p>",
    "parent": { "id": 789, "type": "Kanban::Card", "app_url": "..." },
    "bucket": { "id": 222, "name": "BC5 Calendar", "type": "Project" }
  },
  "trigger": { "mentioned": true, "subscribed": false }
}
```

`app_url` / `url` and `bucket` are the handles the downstream agent uses to pull
full context and resolve the working repo.

The top-level keys mirror the webhook envelope (`id` → `event_id`, `kind`,
`created_at`, `creator`, `details`, `recording`); `trigger` is the one key the
connector owns, carrying the verifier's verdicts on **why** the event targets
the agent, both settled on the re-fetched recording rather than on the POST:

- `mentioned` — the authoritative content carries a mention attachment for the
  agent's Person id (the `agent_mentioned` stamp from verification step 3 —
  the same match the pipeline's mention gate applies).
- `subscribed` — a `comment_created` with no mention of the agent, on a
  recording the live subscribers API confirms the agent subscribes to (the
  `agent_subscribed` stamp from verification step 3).

Every emitted line carries both booleans. A `comment_created` is exactly one
of the two. An assignment or a boost is a directive by `kind` alone:
`subscribed` is `false` for both, and `mentioned` stays a fact about the
authoritative content — an assigned card whose description mentions the agent
reads `true`. A boost is a reaction to the agent's own work, not content that
could mention it: the boost path settles no mention verdict at all, so a boost
reads `false` by construction, whatever its feed representation carries. The
skill reads `trigger` to decide boost vs. no-boost and directive
vs. followed-thread activity, so it never has to decode the mention SGID
against the agent's Person id itself.

A **boost** event (`"kind": "boost_created"`) is synthesized from the agent's
received-boosts feed rather than a webhook: `creator` is the **booster**,
`recording` is the boosted recording (the agent's comment/card/answer — no
`content` field in this feed representation), and `details.boost` carries the
boost's own `id` and `content` (up to 16 characters, e.g. `"🔥"` or `"redo"`).

### Column moves as a trigger

A fifth way to trigger the agent, off unless `--on-column-move` asks for it.
On a board whose columns say what kind of work is wanted, the move *is* the
instruction, and requiring an @mention afterwards only restates the board.

bc3 calls it `kanban_card_adopted`: a card's column is its parent, and
`adopted` is the event for a recording acquiring a new one. `details` carries
`parent_id_was` and `new_parent_id`; the recording's `parent` is the
destination column, titled and typed. None of this is documented — it was
established by reading a real delivery. Todos are re-parented by the same verb
(`todo_adopted`, between lists), which is why the connector matches one exact
kind rather than an `_adopted` suffix: moving a todo between lists says nothing
about what work is wanted.

**Which moves count.** Done and Not-now columns are excluded by *type*
(`Kanban::DoneColumn`, `Kanban::NotNowColumn`), which bc3 assigns structurally
— so the rule survives renaming and translation, where a title match would not.
`--column-move-except` excludes further columns by title. A card landing back
in the column it already occupied is not a change and is dropped, since bc3
emits the adoption whenever a card acquires a parent.

**Trust.** A column move is the same class of privilege as an assignment:
operator-only in every mode unless `--allow-assignments-from-authorized` opts a
mode's authors in, because it starts work and anyone who can see a board can
drag a card across it. Refusing the agent's own events — which every mode does
— is also what makes this non-looping: the agent moves cards itself as work
progresses, and those moves die on the same branch that stops the reply loop.

**Corroboration.** Neither of the existing checks applies. A move's author is
whoever dragged the card, not the card's creator, and the agent need not be an
assignee for the move to be real. Nor is the card's current column enough: a
forger need not move anything, only claim a move into the column the card
already sits in, with any `parent_id_was`.

What bc3 does keep is the move itself. A card's history
(`/buckets/:bucket/recordings/:id/events.json`) records each adoption with its
id, author and both columns, and the webhook's id *is* that event's id —
verified against a real delivery. So the Verifier requires this exact event to
exist, be an `adopted` action and land in the claimed column, and the card to
still sit there. The authoritative event then takes its author and `details`
from that record rather than the POST, so the pipeline's second authorization
and its "did the column actually change" check both run on what Basecamp
recorded. That makes a move better corroborated than an assignment, whose
assigner only the POST names.

**Targeting, and why it is split.** The pipeline does not ask whether the card
is the agent's; an assignee check there would drop moves on cards the agent is
already mid-conversation about, which are exactly the ones a move should drive.
Instead the Verifier stamps `agent_assigned`, and the dispatcher decides: a move
drives a session the card already has, and opens a new one only where the agent
is an assignee. A move on a card with neither is ignored — and ignored *before*
the receipt boost, so nothing on the card implies somebody picked it up.

**Receipt.** Every other trigger names a recording the requester wrote, and
boosting it is the receipt. A move names only the card, which may be weeks old
and already boosted from earlier rounds. bc3 keeps boosts on events as well as
recordings, and the adoption is an event in the card's history whose id is the
webhook's `event_id` — so the receipt is `boost create <card> --event
<event_id>`, and it lands on the move itself. Verified against a live board:
`adopted` events carry a boosts URL, and the neighbouring kinds do not.

**Independent of dispatch mode.** A move is a trigger; dispatch is what happens
after one. Under `--dispatch session` the rules above live in the session
dispatcher. Under the default `--dispatch stdout` the `/basecamp-connect` skill
applies the same ones from the emitted line: drop a move whose
`trigger.assigned` is false before the boost, boost the move event with
`--event <event_id>`, brief the column rather than the card's description, and
leave the card where it is. The one difference is that the skill keeps no
sessions, so "drive the session the card already has" does not arise there.

**Briefing.** A move carries no words, so the card's description must not be
handed over as though newly said; on a follow-up that reads as the requester
repeating the brief and the agent redoes finished work. The prompt says the card
was moved into `<column>`, points at the project's `AGENTS.md` for what that
column means, and tells the session to leave the card where it is — the operator
chose that column, and moving it on would override them and erase the signal.

### Dispatch modes

What happens to an event once it is verified is a setting, because the two
answers suit different situations and neither should be forced on the other.

**`--dispatch stdout`** (the default) is the original arrangement: print the
NDJSON line and stop. Everything downstream — acking, resolving a repo,
dispatching a worker, replying — belongs to whatever is reading, normally the
`/basecamp-connect` skill below. The connector stays dumb-and-safe.

**`--dispatch session`** additionally opens a Claude Code session per *thing of
work*. STDOUT is unaffected — the line is written first and unconditionally —
so a consumer that only reads the stream keeps working. An *active* watcher is
another matter: the `/basecamp-connect` skill dispatches every event it reads,
and running it against a connector that already dispatches means every event is
handled twice. The two are alternatives, one driver per connector, not layers.

The unit is the thing of work, not the event. `Session::Key` resolves a
recording to its root — the parent for a Comment or a chat line, the recording
itself otherwise — so a card, message, todo or document owns exactly one
session and every comment on it joins that session. This is the whole point:
re-reading a card from Basecamp recovers its text, never the reasoning that
followed from it, so a follow-up handled by a fresh agent starts from nothing.

The pieces, all under `lib/basecamp_agent_connector/session/`:

| Class | Responsibility |
| --- | --- |
| `Key` | Resolves an event to the thing of work it belongs to. Pure; reads only the emitted event. |
| `Registry` | Which session owns which key, and what is queued for it. Modelled on `RunRegistry`: atomic rename, `0600`, and a per-key lock so two events racing cannot both open a session. |
| `Claude` | The `claude` CLI — spawn, resume, stop, list. `--background` picks the session id itself (it ignores `--session-id`), so the short id is parsed back off the spawn line and the full uuid looked up from `claude agents --json`. Both are stored: `stop` takes the short one, and `--resume` requires the full one — given the short id it starts a *copy*, which would hand one card two sessions. |
| `RepoResolver` | Reads `config/project_repos.toml`, which until now only the skill read. |
| `Prompt` | What a session is told: the full briefing once, then just the new comment. |
| `Dispatcher` | The decisions below. |
| `DispatchingEmitter` | Wraps the one `Emitter` every pipeline already shares. |

Three properties follow from there being no model in the loop, and each is
handled rather than hoped away:

1. **Nothing can be asked.** A project that resolves to no repo is held, with a
   reply on the recording saying so. Guessing a repo would run an agent
   somewhere arbitrary.
2. **Nothing notices a failure.** A refused spawn is reported on the recording,
   because a boosted card with no reply is indistinguishable from a mention
   that never arrived — the failure the ack exists to prevent.
3. **Nothing can be interrupted safely.** A resident session must be stopped
   before `--resume` will continue it in place; resuming a running one forks a
   *copy* under a new id, which would give one card two sessions. So a comment
   arriving while its session is busy is queued and delivered when the session
   goes quiet, and a flusher thread drains the queue — the alternative,
   delivering on the next event, leaves a comment waiting for as long as the
   card stays quiet.

Two details of `claude agents --json` decide whether that works, and both were
learned from a live board rather than the docs:

- **Busy is `status`, not `state` or liveness.** `state` is the lifecycle
  (`working`, `blocked`, `done`); `status` is what the session is doing right
  now (`busy`, `idle`), reported only while it is resident. A session can sit
  at `state: working, status: idle` with a live pid — between turns, or
  finished and not yet reaped — and treating that as busy holds the card's
  messages for as long as the process lingers. When `status` is absent the
  session is not resident, and the question falls back to whether its process
  is alive, since the CLI leaves `state` at `working` when a session dies
  mid-turn.
- **Not knowing is not "gone".** When the listing cannot be read at all,
  residency is unknown, and the two guesses are not equally safe: stopping a
  session that turns out not to be resident costs nothing, while resuming one
  that is forks the card. So only a definite "not listed" earns a plain
  resume; anything else stops first. This matters most right after a restart,
  when the first event arrives just as the CLI is least able to answer. The
  same goes for busy: a follow-up is continued only on a definite "idle", and
  a listing the CLI could not give holds it for the flusher, since stopping a
  session that may be mid-work would throw its work away.

A message leaves the queue only once a resume actually went through. The
flusher's check, resume and queue update are one decision under the card's
registry lock — the lock a webhook delivery takes too — so a comment arriving
mid-flush waits rather than continuing the session in between. A resume that
fails keeps every message queued, a direct follow-up whose resume fails is
queued rather than dropped, and a stop that fails on a session still listed is
not followed by a resume, because that resume would fork it. A spawn that
cannot even start (a mapped repo that does not exist) is reported on the card
like any refused spawn.

A dispatched session must never sit blocked on a question. Nothing watches its
terminal, and the CLI's session log is raw terminal output rather than text, so
a blocked session is unreadable as well as unattended. The prompt instructs it
to post the question to Basecamp and end its turn; the answer arrives as a
comment on the same recording, routes to the same key, and continues it. That
makes Basecamp the input channel and needs no supervisor.

Sessions deliberately outlive the connector: they are their own processes, the
registry is on disk, and a restart picks them up again.

**Security.** Dispatched sessions run unattended at
`--session-permission-mode` (default `acceptEdits`). The operator-only trust
filter is unchanged and is what stands between a Basecamp comment and a command
running locally — but it is now the *only* thing, where before a person was
watching a terminal. The mode is an explicit flag rather than an inherited
default for that reason.

## Component 2: `/basecamp-connect` skill

**Artifact**: `skills/basecamp-connect/SKILL.md` — a Claude Code project skill (YAML
frontmatter: `name: basecamp-connect`, `description`, trigger keywords; body: the
operating instructions below). This is a first-class deliverable of the project,
not just runtime glue.

### Invocation

```
/basecamp-connect @Clawdito --project "BC5 Calendar"               # one project
/basecamp-connect @Clawdito --project "BC5 Calendar" --project HEY  # several
```

`@AGENT` and flags pass through to `bin/connect`.

### Behavior

The skill's session thread — the **front thread** — is an orchestrator, not a
worker: it watches, acknowledges, and dispatches. Everything that reads
Basecamp beyond the event line, or touches a repo, belongs to the dispatched
agent. The split exists because an ack that lives in the dispatched agent's
list drifts whenever the front thread drifts into working the event itself,
and a mention received in seconds but unacknowledged for half an hour is
indistinguishable from a missed one (connector PR #17).

1. **Launch the bridge** — run `bin/connect @Clawdito --project ...`
   and tail its STDOUT. The skill watches continuously until the user stops it
   (which triggers the teardown above).
2. **Per trusted event** (one NDJSON line), the front thread routes by the line
   itself. A line carrying `review_id`/`repo`/`state` and no `recording` is a
   **GitHub review** (`--repo` runs; see [`pr-review-loop.md`](pr-review-loop.md)):
   no boost, no bucket lookup — it is dispatched straight to the review loop in
   the repo named by `repo`, and an `approved` review is dispatched as an
   approval that may land the PR only when `reviewer` is the operator's GitHub
   login. The connector enforces that gate itself (`GitHub::ReviewPipeline`):
   any other reviewer's approval never reaches this stream. Neither does a
   review of a pull request somebody else opened — the webhook watches the
   whole repo, so other teams' PRs come down the same wire, and a review of one
   is not this operator's work. Neither does a
   `commented` review by the operator's own login whose body and every inline
   comment start with 🤖 — the dispatched agent, posting under that account,
   replying to a thread on its own PR. Anything written in it without the
   marker makes it a person's review, and it arrives. A line carrying `recording` is a Basecamp
   event; one whose `creator` is the agent is dropped before anything else.
   `creator` is the only checkable key — the emitted `recording` carries no
   author, and a `boost_created` line's `recording` is the agent's own work by
   definition, which is not what this test reads. For every other Basecamp
   event the front thread runs exactly this checklist:
   a. **Acknowledge** — `basecamp boost create <recording.url> "On it!"
      --profile <agent>` on receipt, before repo resolution and before
      dispatch, so the ack lands within seconds regardless of what dispatch
      does. It is the single ack for every directive trigger — mentions,
      assignments, and Campfire lines (boost the line). Exactly two kinds of
      event get **no** boost: a comment on a subscribed thread (a
      `comment_created` whose content carries no mention attachment with the
      agent's Person id) and a `boost_created` event. Retry the call only on
      the two failures that occur before any request is sent —
      `Not authenticated for profile:` and `token refresh failed:`, the
      credential-store failure the CLI shows under concurrent invocations —
      a few times with a short pause; any other failure may already have
      landed the boost, so it is not retried. Whether the boost verifiably
      landed is recorded for the handoff.
   b. **Resolve working repo** — infer the local repo from the project name. Basecamp
      project names carry an app token (e.g. a `BC5 …` project → the Basecamp
      repo under `~/Work/<org>/<repo>`). A configurable mapping table backs the
      heuristic. **If the project can't be mapped to a repo, ask the user
      interactively** which repo to use (do not guess, do not silently fall
      back). An ack must never precede an indefinite silence: before stopping
      to ask — or when the dispatch in *c* fails — the front thread posts one
      **holding reply** as the agent that @mentions the requester, saying the
      event is received but held and why. It is the only reply the front
      thread ever posts, and only on directive triggers.
   c. **Dispatch an in-session background agent** that owns the event
      end-to-end, running in the resolved repo. The handoff carries the event
      `kind`, the instruction as that kind defines it, the recording and
      parent URLs, the agent profile, the requester (the event `creator`), and
      whether the front thread's boost landed. The instruction per trigger:
      - **mention** (comment, message, Campfire line) — the recording's **raw
        HTML content with the agent mention removed** (the rest of the markup
        — links, other mentions — kept intact);
      - **assignment** (`*_assignment_changed`) — the recording itself; the
        card/todo's `title`/`content` is the task, and there is no mention to
        strip;
      - **`boost_created`** — `details.boost.content` (the signal) plus the
        boosted `recording`, which has no `content` in this representation;
      - **subscribed-thread comment** — the comment as context on a followed
        thread, not a directive.
      Agents appear in the current Claude session. **No concurrency cap** —
      every trusted event is dispatched immediately.
   d. **Return to the monitor.** The front thread never reads the recording,
      gathers context, investigates, runs repo commands, does the work, or
      posts the reply.
3. **The dispatched agent**, in order:
   a. **Fallback boost** — only when the handoff says the front thread's boost
      did not land, post the same `On it!` boost, without listing the
      recording's boosts first. A front-thread call that Basecamp accepted
      but reported as failed then yields a second `On it!`; that is accepted —
      a rare duplicate reaction over a missing ack — because a check-first
      listing can fail the same transient way and would have to decide which
      earlier event an older `On it!` on the same recording belonged to. The
      same two exceptions apply: subscribed-thread comments and
      `boost_created` events are never boosted.
   b. **Gather context** — pull the surrounding Basecamp context with the
      `basecamp` CLI: the recording itself, its `parent` (card/message), the
      thread/comments, and the project. Basecamp is the context store; the event
      is the trigger + pointer.
   c. **Do the work** a directive trigger asks for, posting one short interim
      reply as the agent when it runs past roughly ten minutes (what it is
      doing, where to follow — the PR link once it exists, marked in progress,
      never done).
   d. **Reply as the agent** on a directive trigger — post results to the
      originating recording with `basecamp comment <recording> "<body>"
      --profile <agent>` so the reply is authored by the agent user:
      - **Success** — a results comment where the mention was written.
      - **Failure** (agent errors / can't complete) — a short error summary
        comment that **@mentions the requester (event creator)** so it surfaces
        as a notification. You always learn when a dispatch failed.
      Replying as the agent (a distinct user from the operator) is what stops the
      reply from re-triggering the connector.
   e. **Non-directive events are read, not worked.** A subscribed-thread
      comment and a `boost_created` signal are dispatched the same way but
      default to silence: no interim reply, no results comment, no card moves.
      The agent replies only when a response adds value — a question it can
      answer on the followed thread, or a corrective boost (`redo`, `wrong`,
      `👎`) that sends it back to the boosted work; an approving boost (`👍`,
      `🔥`) is applause and gets nothing. Both policies are provisional until
      real traffic tunes them.

## Webhook payload reference (from bc3)

Confirmed against `bc3` source (`app/views/api/webhooks/event.jbuilder`,
`app/views/api/recordings/_recording.json.jbuilder`,
`app/models/webhook/delivery.rb`, `app/models/webhook.rb`).

- **Top-level keys**: `id`, `kind`, `details`, `created_at`, `recording`,
  `creator`, (`copy` for copied events).
- **`kind`**: `"<container>_<action>"`, e.g. `comment_created`,
  `message_created`, `kanban_card_created`, `message_content_changed`. The
  connector subscribes to `*_created`, `*_content_changed`, `*_active`, and
  `*_assignment_changed` (assignment events carry `details.added_person_ids` /
  `removed_person_ids`).
- **Drafts and `*_active`**: a recording written as a draft and published later
  never delivers a `*_created` event. bc3 records that event while the recording
  is `drafted` and refuses to relay it (`Webhook.eligible_event?` drops any event
  whose recording is `drafted?`), and it never re-relays it once the draft goes
  live. What it relays instead is the publication itself: `drafted => active` is
  tracked as the action `active` (`Recording::Eventable#track_status_change`) and
  named `<container>_active` — `message_active`, `document_active`,
  `upload_active`. So a mention typed into a draft arrives under `*_active` or
  not at all. bc3 pairs the two kinds the same way internally
  (`Event::Categorized::CATEGORIZED_KINDS = %w[ message_created message_active ]`)
  but deliberately does not normalize them on the webhook path.
- **`recording`**: `id`, `status`, `type` (Ruby class: `Comment`, `Message`,
  `Kanban::Card`, `Todo`, …), `title`, `url` (API JSON), `app_url` (browser),
  `bookmark_url`, `parent` {id,title,type,url,app_url}, `bucket` {id,name,type},
  `creator` (person), and **`content`** — the human-typed text. For rich-text
  types `content` is **HTML**; for `Todo` it's the plain todo title.
- **`creator`** (person): `id`, `name`, `email_address`, `personable_type`
  (`User`/`Client`), `admin`, `owner`, `client`, `employee`, `time_zone`,
  `avatar_url`, etc. `email_address` is the match key for the operator (the `id`
  here is an account-scoped Person id, distinct from the identity id returned by
  `basecamp me`).
- **HTTP headers on delivery**: `Content-Type: application/json`,
  `User-Agent: Basecamp3 Webhook`, `X-Request-Id: <uuid>`. **No HMAC signature**
  — there is no shared-secret signature to verify, which is *why* authoritative
  API verification (not the payload) is the trust gate.
- **Delivery semantics**: at-least-once, up to 10 retries on non-2xx before the
  webhook is deactivated; redirects not followed. → answer 200 only once the
  event is settled (dedup by `event.id`), 503 to request redelivery.
- **Scope**: per-bucket (= per-project). Type filtering possible but cannot be
  scoped narrower than a project. Limit: 50 active webhooks per project.

## Configuration

| Key | What | Default |
|-----|------|---------|
| Linked identity | Basecamp user id (+ email) for the filter target & reply identity | CLI-authed user (`clawdito`) |
| Watched projects | Explicit `--project` list (name/URL/ID), required | — (at least one) |
| Project→repo map | Maps Basecamp project names / app tokens to local repo paths under `~/Work/<org>/<repo>` | heuristic + ask-on-miss |
| Default event types | Subscribed Basecamp types | `Comment, Message, Kanban::Card, Kanban::Step, Todo` + `Chat::Line` (polled — chat has no webhooks) |
| Boost poll | Received-boosts feed poll interval (`--no-boosts` disables) | 60s |
| Local port | WEBrick bind port | unused high port |

---

## Code style

Follow Basecamp's house style — `~/Work/basecamp/bc3/STYLE.md` is the reference,
and bc3's `.rubocop.yml` is adopted as the lint baseline. This is a plain Ruby
gem (no Rails), so the Rails/Active Record sections don't apply, but the general
Ruby rules do:

- **No comments** unless they flag genuinely non-obvious behavior. The code
  should read on its own.
- **Expanded conditionals over guard clauses**, with the documented exceptions
  (early return at the very top of a method, or when the body is non-trivial).
  **No ternaries** — prefer `if`/`else`.
- **Method ordering**: class methods, then public methods (`initialize` first),
  then private. Order methods vertically by invocation order so the flow reads
  top-to-bottom.
- **Visibility modifiers**: no blank line under `private`; indent the methods
  beneath it. For a module that is all private methods, `private` at the top with
  a blank line after and no indent.
- **`!` suffix** only for methods with a non-bang counterpart — never to flag
  "destructive."
- **Fail fast and loud.** Don't paper over unexpected `nil`/missing state with
  `&.` or silent fallbacks; let it raise so bugs surface. (e.g. a missing
  webhook id on teardown is worth reporting, not swallowing.)

## Testing

We value tests highly and keep the code tight: **aim for ≥2 lines of test per
line of production code.** The bc3 testing philosophy (`STYLE.md` §Tests)
applies, adapted to a non-Rails gem:

- **Minitest only** — Ruby's stdlib `minitest`, no extra frameworks, helpers, or
  DSLs unless genuinely necessary.
- **One test file per class**, mirroring `lib/` under `test/` (e.g.
  `lib/basecamp_agent_connector/pipeline.rb` → `test/pipeline_test.rb`).
- **Test the public interface only** — never test private methods directly.
  Drive them through the public API so tests survive refactoring.
- **Group related assertions** in one test case rather than splitting every
  assertion into its own `test` block.
- **Never mock our own code.** The external boundary here is the **`basecamp` and
  `tailscale` CLI subprocesses** — that's the equivalent of HTTP in a Rails app.
  To make it testable without mocking our classes, the components that shell out
  (`basecamp_cli`, `tunnel`, `webhooks`) take an injectable **command runner**;
  tests pass a fake runner returning canned CLI output/exit status. Reach for
  Mocha only as a last resort, and never metaprogram stubs (`define_method`).
- **Test behavior, not implementation** — assert on emitted output and observable
  effects, not on internal structure.
- **Fake data** uses `example.com` / `example.org` for any URLs or emails.

Coverage the suite must include:

| Unit | What to assert |
|------|----------------|
| Mention matching | a mention attachment naming the agent matches; a mention of a different user does not; plain text naming the agent does not |
| Operator filter | events authored by the operator pass; events from any other user are dropped |
| Kind filter | `*_created`, `*_content_changed`, `*_active` and `*_assignment_changed` pass; other kinds dropped |
| Draft publishing | a `*_active` event mentioning the agent emits exactly once; a recording Basecamp still marks `drafted` emits nothing |
| Dedup | a repeated `event.id` is dropped; distinct ids pass |
| Verification | corroborated event (CLI returns matching recording) dispatches; forged event (CLI says not found / mismatched creator) is rejected |
| Emitter | one well-formed NDJSON line per verified event |
| Webhooks | registers one webhook per project; teardown deletes all, continuing past a single failure and reporting it |
| Identity | expired token triggers a single `auth refresh`; still-failing exits with a clear message |
| Projects | explicit `--project` list honored; empty list enumerates all accessible projects |
| CLI/arg parsing | flags map to the right config; required `<trigger>` enforced |
| Boost poller | first fetch baselines without replaying history; a post-start boost emits once; an uncorroborated boost is retried while it stays in the feed; a full all-new page warns of possible overflow |

## Security considerations

- **Forged POST is the real threat**, not just a wrong author. The funnel URL is
  public and Basecamp sends no signature, so anyone could POST a payload claiming
  `creator = <operator>`. The author filter alone cannot stop this.
  **Mitigation: authoritative verification** — every event is re-fetched from
  Basecamp and only acted on if Basecamp corroborates it (existence + creator +
  content). A secret URL path is a cheap first gate on top.
- **Prompt injection** — payload text flows into an agent that can run commands.
  Two layers defend it: (1) only events authored by the **operator** (and
  @mentioning the agent) are acted on, and (2) the content is re-fetched from
  Basecamp (not taken from the POST body). Treat all content as untrusted
  regardless; keep agents scoped to the resolved repo.
- **Public endpoint hygiene** — the server only honors `POST /bc5/<secret>` and
  ignores everything else.
- **Teardown** — webhook + funnel are removed on exit, minimizing the window in
  which a public endpoint exists.

---

## Decisions resolved

- Trigger: a real @mention of the **agent** user (a local CLI profile of the
  same name, validated at startup), authored by the **operator** — **or** the
  operator **assigning** the agent a card/todo — **or** a new comment (authored
  by an authorized user) on a recording the agent **subscribes** to.
- Subscription trigger: a `comment_created` with no mention, when the agent is a
  subscriber of the comment's parent (the commented-on card/todo/message —
  subscriptions live on the container, not the comment). Corroborated by
  re-fetching the parent's subscribers (`basecamp subscriptions show`) and
  matching the agent's Person id; the author is gated exactly as a mention is
  (operator by default, else the active trust mode's authors), and the agent's
  own comments never re-trigger because its identity never authorizes.
- Boost trigger: someone boosts the agent's work. A boost never fires a webhook
  (not a Recording, no Event), so the bridge polls the **agent's own
  received-boosts feed** (`/my/boosts.json`, the report behind the "You've got
  Boosts!" notification) every `--boost-poll` seconds (default 60) and
  synthesizes a `boost_created` event per new entry. The booster is gated
  exactly as a mention author is (operator by default, else the active trust
  mode's authors; the agent's own boosts never authorize), corroboration is a
  fresh fetch of the same feed (claimed id present with the claimed booster;
  emitted booster/content/recording all from the fetch), and feed membership is
  the targeting fact. The agent's view of the feed **redacts other users'
  emails** (bc3 shows real addresses only to yourself or an admin), so the
  booster matches by account Person id; email-keyed trust modes (`allowlist`,
  `domain`) therefore cannot broaden the boost trigger beyond the operator
  unless the agent can see emails — `project` mode, keyed on the corroborated
  Person id and client flag, broadens it fine. History is baselined by time, never dispatched; the feed
  is account-wide, so the bound is the agent's identity rather than the
  watched-project list. `--no-boosts` disables the trigger.
- Assignment trigger: the documented-but-previously-undocumented
  `todo_assignment_changed` / `kanban_card_assignment_changed` /
  `kanban_step_assignment_changed` events (bc3 PR #12156). Actionable when
  authored by the operator **and** `details.added_person_ids` includes the agent
  — corroborated by re-fetching the recording and confirming the agent is among
  its current `assignees` (the recording has no "who assigned" field, so the
  assigner identity rests on the operator-author check + the secret URL path,
  as with mentions). To receive them, the default subscribed types now include
  `Todo` and `Kanban::Step` (`Kanban::Card` already covered cards). The
  assignment is acknowledged by the same `On it!` boost as a mention (boosts
  work on todos and cards too); the dispatched agent then works the card/todo
  as the instruction.
- Ack: the **front thread** boosts the recording `On it!` as the agent on
  receipt — before repo resolution and dispatch — retrying only the two
  pre-request credential failures (`Not authenticated for profile:`, `token
  refresh failed:`). The dispatched agent boosts only as a fallback, when the
  handoff says the front thread's boost did not land, and without listing
  first: a rare duplicate reaction is accepted over a missing ack.
  Subscribed-thread comments and `boost_created` events get no boost from
  either (connector PR #17).
- Reply: post results back **as the agent** (`basecamp comment --profile
  <agent>`). On failure, post an error summary that @mentions the requester
  (the event creator — under a broadened trust mode not necessarily the
  operator).
- Dedup: in-memory, keyed on `event.id`; 200 once settled (emitted, dropped,
  or a duplicate), 503 only when Basecamp could not be asked — a transient CLI
  failure that outlasts `Basecamp::Client`'s own retries — so bc3's delivery
  job redelivers with backoff instead of settling a real mention as
  uncorroborated (connector PR #18). A delivery is never answered before its
  verdict.
- Working dir: infer from project name (app token → repo); **ask interactively**
  on miss.
- Triggers: `*_created`, `*_content_changed`, `*_active` (a draft published
  after the fact — the only delivery its mention ever gets), and
  `*_assignment_changed`.
- Mention match: a mention attachment (`application/vnd.basecamp.mention`)
  whose SGID carries the agent's Person id — not a plain-text token, and not
  the display name, which is not unique.
- Instruction form: raw HTML content with the agent mention removed.
- Scope: `--project` is required (BC3 has no global webhook); repeatable for
  several projects. One funnel + one server + one secret path; one webhook
  registered per watched project. The `basecamp` CLI resolves project names to
  IDs.
- Lifecycle: tear down all webhooks + funnel on exit.
- Forgery defense: authoritative Basecamp API verification (+ secret URL path).
- Token expiry: auto `basecamp auth refresh` once at startup, then fail with a
  clear message (no auto `login`).
- Dispatch: in-session background agents.
- Concurrency: unbounded.
- Server: WEBrick (stdlib, zero deps).
