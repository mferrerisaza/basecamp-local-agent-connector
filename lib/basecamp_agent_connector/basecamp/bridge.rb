# The Basecamp transport, as a self-contained route on the shared server: it owns
# its secret path, registers a webhook per project against the shared funnel, and
# turns each delivery into a verified, emitted event.
#
# Campfire chat is the one watched surface webhooks cannot carry (bc3 excludes
# chat kinds from relay outright), so chat-typed entries in `types` are split
# off into a ChatPoller instead of the webhook registration. Boosts are just as
# webhook-infeasible (a Boost creates no Event in bc3), so the bridge also runs
# a BoostPoller over the agent's own received-boosts feed. All sources feed
# identical pipelines: authorizer pre-filter, corroborating re-fetch,
# authoritative re-check, one STDOUT funnel.
#
# The deliveries the webhook route never received are a source of their own: on
# the webhook re-check's tick a DeliveryReconciler reads each registration's own
# delivery history and replays the recorded body of every delivery that failed,
# through this same webhook pipeline (see DeliveryReconciler).

  # Each delivery is verified on the request thread and answered with its
  # verdict: 200 once the event is settled (emitted, dropped, or a
  # duplicate), 503 when Basecamp could not be asked. bc3 retries any
  # non-2xx delivery (Webhook::DeliveryJob: polynomially_longer backoff,
  # 10 attempts, then the webhook is deactivated), so a 503 is a request
  # for redelivery — of an event whose id the pipeline has forgotten, so the
  # redelivery gets a fresh attempt. Everything else answers 200: an
  # impostor payload, a malformed body, and a pipeline bug are settled here,
  # and redelivering them would only repeat the same outcome. Overrunning
  # bc3's 10s delivery timeout is harmless (a timed-out delivery is
  # redelivered and then deduped or re-verified), just wasteful.
  #
  # A failure that stays transient through all 10 attempts (~4.3h: a
  # revoked credential reports auth_required on every call, exactly like the
  # keyring race) ends with bc3 deactivating the webhook, silently. The
  # WebhookMonitor reactivates it on its next check, but a credential still
  # broken just fails the next ten deliveries too, so the 503 log line names
  # the remedy — fix the CLI's credentials. Which call could not be answered
  # — the recording fetch, or the subscriber lookup after it — is in the
  # error's message, which names the failed command.
  #
  # Because the work is on the request thread, shutdown (WEBrick joins its
  # request threads before `start` returns) waits for in-flight deliveries
  # to be answered before teardown deletes the webhooks, so none is lost to
  # a Ctrl-C. The wait is bounded only by the CLI's own timeouts, which on
  # a stalled network can run to minutes.
